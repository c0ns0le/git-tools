# Useful git configuration options

These are not required for any of these scripts, but I find them to be nice to have.

 *  git config credential.helper cache
    - So you don't have to retype your password more than every 15 minutes

 *  git config --global alias.ls "log --stat --pretty=short --graph"
    - An easy view of the commit graph
